## 🧮 Experiment 1: Using Formulas in Excel  

**Aim**  
To perform basic and advanced calculations using Excel formulas.  

**Steps**  
1. Open Microsoft Excel and create a new workbook.  
2. Enter the following sample data:

4. Drag the Fill Handle down to apply it to other rows.  
5. Try other basic formulas:  
   - Subtraction → `=A1-B1`  
   - Multiplication → `=A1*B1`  
   - Division → `=A1/B1`  
   - Average → `=AVERAGE(A1:B3)`  
   - Sum → `=SUM(A1:B3)`  
6. Try an advanced function:  
   - `=IF(A1>20,"High","Low")`  

**Result**  
Successfully used Excel formulas to calculate and analyze data.
